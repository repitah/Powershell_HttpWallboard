# Powershell_HttpWallboard
Basic web / HTTP based wallboard written in powershell that is modular.


Current modules included: 
  - Root web page (where the design and layout for the modules can be done)
  - Active Directory (account Expried, password locked out, password expired)
  - OpenNMS (display currently outages that aren't acknowledged)
 
There is a space in the current design to display open IT tickets (top of screen), however, not included in the public/open due to being custom for my environment.
